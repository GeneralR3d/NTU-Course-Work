Sum of n odd numbers:

suppose we take following n numbers-

=1+3+5+7

=1+(2+1)+(3+2)+(4+3) we can write again as..

=[1+2+3+4] +[1+2+3]

=[Sum of n natural numbers]+[Sum of (n-1) natural numbers]

=n(n+1)/2 + (n-1) [(n-1)+1]/2 By solving it,we find

=[n^2+n]/2+[n^2-n]/2 again we can simplify as

=(2n^2)/2

=n^2
